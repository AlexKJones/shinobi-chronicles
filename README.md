## Contributing

Recommended workflow

- Fork repo on GitHub (top right)
- Clone your fork to your local machine
- Add remote of original repo to your local clone
  -  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/levimeahan/shinobi-chronicles.git`
- Make changes to your local and test, push to your forked repo on GH
- Open a pull request from fork => original repo
- After pull request is merged (and periodically to avoid conflicts) update your local fork from the original repo
  - `git pull upstream main`
