## Contributing

Recommended workflow

1. Fork repo on GitHub (top right)

2. Clone your fork to your local machine (you can find the URL to clone under "Code")

3. Make changes to your local and test, push to your forked repo on GH
4. Open a pull request from fork => original repo
   - There's a "Contribute" button on the main page of your fork you can use to compare and open a pull request

5. After pull request is merged (and before starting work on a new feature if it's been more than a day or two) update your local fork from the original repo  
   - You can either do this via the command line, or the GitHub UI
   - For command line:
     - First, add a remote of the primary repo to your local clone
       - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/levimeahan/shinobi-chronicles.git`
     - Then when you want to update your local, run
       - `git pull upstream main`
   - For GUI
     - You should see a prompt on the main page of your fork repository when it's behind, with a button to click (Image TBD)
